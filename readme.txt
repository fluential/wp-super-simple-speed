Super Simple Speed is a stable and powerful plugin that dramatically increases your site speed without any hassle (or clutter).

== Description ==

Super Simple Speed is a stable and powerful plugin that dramatically increases your page load speed and gives you a better score on the major speed testing services. Unlike most other similar plugins, WP Super Simple Speed is lightweight (less than 10kb in size), and has no clutter or unnecessary code or configs. Simply, speed ! 

Super Simple Speed will switch your site to 5th gear without any hassle!

= How the plugin works =

Once activated, the plugin will automatically write several speed and optimization rules to your root .htaccess file (without altering or breaking any existing rules in your .htaccess).

= Features =

	√ automatic hotlink protection to prevent bandwith stealing
	√ leverages browser caching by setting http header expires (reduces http requests)
	√ gzip compression using mod deflate(speeds up page load time and saves bandwith by 70%)
	√ automatically sets UTF-8 encoding for files being served as text/html or text/plain
	√ enables keepalive (allowing persistent connections) which saves on bandwith
	√ removes unnecessary clutter from wp head (rsd, version generator, and much more)
	√ dequeues extra fontAwesome stylesheets loaded to your theme by other plugins
	√ moves all enqueued javascript files to footer while keeping css in header
	√ removes query strings from all static resources 
	√ plugin is less than 10kb in size 
	√ no unnecessary code or clutter 
	√ no configurations needed 
	
= Backup =

Please make sure that you make a backup of your root .htaccess before installing this plugin (just good practice). 

= Uninstalling (important) =

Should you for any reason whatsoever decide to deactivate & uninstall this plugin - do keep in mind that doing so will result in your root .htaccess being wiped clean. When this happens, simply head over to your permalink settings and re-save your current permalink structure (this will prevent your site from breaking). Alternatively, you can upload your backed up .htaccess file. Then again, there is no reason to deactivate and uninstall this plugin as it doesn't alter your current .htaccess settings - it simply adds to it !
